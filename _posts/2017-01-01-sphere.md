Millions of spontaneous money transfers occur everyday, but the mobile experience remains mundane and takes too long. We realized that one of the biggest barriers to donating money is that people don't know how to, and when it comes to transferring money to people, users are frustrated by the menial particulars such as routing numbers, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. We wanted to simplify the process of donating money to organizations or transferring money to people through a single seamless process that requires raising a phone camera to the recipient. By reforming the mobile money transfer process, we believe we can revitalize civic and social participation by reducing traditional barriers to funding.
