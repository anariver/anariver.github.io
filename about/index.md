Graduating as a computer engineer with a minor in applied mathematics on May 2018. Even though I reserve my right to say "trust me, I'm an engineer!", I consider myself as a well-rounded computer scientist.

I have over 4 years of experience in full stack software development, from high-level web development to low-level embedded systems. My areas of interest include data mining, web scraping, audio analysis and natural language processing. I am also interested in hardware development with Arduino and FPGAs.

## Resumes

My resumes are written in LaTex. I have two versions of my resume for the different hats I like to wear.
