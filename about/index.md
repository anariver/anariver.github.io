Ana Ortez-Rivera was born and raised in Washington D.C. and the proud daughter of Salvadorean immigrants. She is a 2018 graduate of the University of Maryland - College Park, where she studies Social-Cultural Anthropology, Latin American Studies, and International Development and Conflict Resolution. Her passion lies in education policy and therefore decided to work at the Next Step Public Charter School as a school counselor/advisor. In this role, Ana helped GED and ESL students navigate college and career options. She served low-income, minority, and immigrant students who faced barriers and extraordinary challenges in their educational journey. After facing local and state challenges that created barriers for her studentâ€™s educational attainment beyond the GED, Ana was motivated to earn her MPP.

She loves taking long naps and finding free food on campus.
